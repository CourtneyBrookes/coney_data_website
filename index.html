            <h1>This is PinniWatch</h1>
            <p>Welcome to PinniWatch, your ultimate solution for identifying and distinguishing seals and sea lions in marine environments. PinniWatch employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology, specifically harnessing the formidable AlexNet deep neural network architecture to ensure accurate and reliable marine life identification.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Dataset Section -->
        <section id="dataset">
            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>At the heart of PinniWatch's effectiveness is a meticulously curated dataset comprising 100 images. This dataset is thoughtfully composed to represent the marine ecosystem comprehensively. It encompasses 50 images depicting charismatic seals and sea lions, providing the system with the key features and traits that define these marine mammals. The remaining 50 images offer a contrast, showcasing the vastness of the ocean and the diverse marine wildlife that coexists in these ecosystems.</p>

        <!-- AlexNet Section -->
        <section id="alexnet">
            <h2>AlexNet: A Deep Learning Powerhouse</h2>
            <p>PinniWatch's engine is built upon the renowned AlexNet architecture, a revolutionary convolutional neural network (CNN) that broke new ground in the field of computer vision. Developed by Krizhevsky et al. in 2012, AlexNet achieved a significant leap in image recognition accuracy, sparking a new era of deep learning.</p>

            <p>The AlexNet architecture boasts a complex yet powerful design, comprising multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. This intricate structure empowers PinniWatch to dissect the input images, extracting intricate features such as shapes, textures, and patterns that are characteristic of seals and sea lions.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- How It Works Section -->
        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How PinniWatch Works</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> PinniWatch places a strong emphasis on data preprocessing. Before feeding the images into the neural network, they undergo a series of transformations. These transformations include resizing images, normalizing color channels, and augmentation techniques to enhance the network's ability to learn from the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> The convolutional layers within the AlexNet architecture act as feature extractors. They meticulously analyze the images, recognizing key elements like flippers, whiskers, and distinctive markings that distinguish seals and sea lions from their marine counterparts.</li>
                <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Following feature extraction, the fully connected layers in AlexNet perform the classification task. PinniWatch assigns a label to each image, categorizing it as either a seal or sea lion or a different marine species.</li>
                <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> PinniWatch doesn't stop at classification; it provides real-time predictions. This means you can use the system to swiftly and accurately identify these marine mammals in any given marine environment.</li>
            </ol>
